# UsePopcorn - Movie tracking app

## Functionalities
Movies are fetched using an API, and it is possible to see the comprehensive details of the movies, including iMDB rating, description, actors and etc. You can add movies to your watched list by simply rating them, and see the total statistics about your movie preference.

## Credits
I created this project during Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React tutorial.
